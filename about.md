* More a social media observer than user. 
* Multilingual, yet sometimes encountering language switch failures.
* Co-existence with simplicity and complexity.

* Firm believer in Fluid Identity.
* Know more about sociological theory than the actual knowledge of being social. 
* Formless, Shapeless, Rootless.
