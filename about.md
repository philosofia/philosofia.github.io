### Hi there, I am Sophia.
I know 140-character tweeting is all the rage, but I still think a way to organize my random and messy thoughts is needed. 

##### But why? Here's the reason.

##### Some fun facts about me:

* Currently study BA Digital Culture at King's College London.
* Interested in intersection of Social Science, Humanities and Data Science.
* ADD Brainer.
* Non-linearity reader. Don't ever try to ask me how many books I've read.
* More a social media observer than user. 
* Multilingual, yet sometimes encountering language switch failures.
* Co-existence with simplicity and complexity.
* Challenge ideas, never people.
* Cook the most delicious braised pork belly in this world. (actually it is debatable)
