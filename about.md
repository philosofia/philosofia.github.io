### Something about me:

* Currently study BA Digital Culture at King's College London.
* Interested in intersection of Social Science, Humanities and Data Science.
* ADD Brainer.
* Non-linearity reader. Don't ever try to ask me how many books I've read.
* More a social media observer than user. 
* Multilingual, yet sometimes encountering language switch failures.
* Co-existence with simplicity and complexity.
* Challenge ideas, never people.
* Cook the most delicious braised pork belly in this world. (Actually it is debatable, but whatever)
* Big fan of Yakinuku and Takoyaki. 
* Firm believer in Fluid Identity.
* Know more about sociological theory than the actual knowledge of being social. 
* Formless, Shapeless, Rootless.
* Beginner mindset.
* Spent more time reading histories about programming language and computer science than I have actually coded (in python primarily).
* Autodidacticism.
* Suffer from Imposter syndrome periodically at every semeseter.
* Beyasian.
* Love reading K-pop Vocalists' Vocal Analyses.
* Student by day, singer by night (I mean, in my shower).
